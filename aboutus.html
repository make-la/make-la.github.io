	<p>Spring 2021 (March to June) will be our pilot program, which will be held completely remotely. We will start by introducing students to the basics of computer-aided design (CAD) using an interactive tutorial that will give students a chance to customize a keychain. As the program progesses, students will learn more about designing for other fabrication equiptment available in the MakerSpace. By the end of the program, students will be able to apply the skills they've learned by designing their own original project. Due to COVID-19, the students will not be able to visit the MakerSpace in person, however MakeLA staff will use the students' digital designs to create each student's project. The projects will then be delivered safely to LAUSD for students to take home. The program will be available at no cost to LAUSD students.</p>
	
	<p>LAUSD students who are interested will first need to complete an application to help us find the students who are excited about making! Students from underserved schools will be given priority. Students will need a laptop computer in order to join Zoom lectures and access other program materials &#8212; don't hesistate to contact the email below if you need help getting the tools you need to join MakeLA!</p>
